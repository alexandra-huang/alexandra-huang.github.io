I am particularly interested in designing experiences and products that are intuitive and easy-to-use, since I believe that users should not have to spend much time figuring out how a product or website works before they use it. I appreciate beautiful and intuitive interfaces in websites and products and strive to emulate that in my own work.</p>

I agreed, with the ultimate goal being to update the look and feel of the websites, modernizing them by making them responsive so that students could view the sites from their phones, as well as to improve the navigation and flow of the existing websites. (The two sites are similarly structured and run, so the new design would run across both sites.)</p>

                            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

                            <p>In order to get a better idea of how to structure a website for a college course, I did an informal competitive analysis (since the professor didn’t have any specific requirements for the site, and she left it up to me to decide how it would look). I started out by looking at other UCSD computer science course websites.</p>

                            <p>Some course websites I used for inspiration and ideas:</p>
                            <br>

                            <img src="img/comp1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Competitor 1">
                            <img src="img/comp2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Competitor 2">
                            <img src="img/comp3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Competitor 3">
                            <img src="img/comp4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Competitor 4">

                            <br>

                            <h3>Ideation</h3>

                            <p>From the competitors/similar computer science course websites from both UCSD and other colleges that I looked at, as well as the existing version of the CSE 3 & 7 websites I was designing for, I figured out which aspects were held in common and went from there. For example, all of the sites I looked at included a syllabus, some kind of course schedule, a place to put the programming assignments, announcements, and some other course-specific information.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>What I liked in site #1 as well as #3 was the tabular format for the assignments and quizzes, since it made it more clear what material corresponded to each week of the quarter. Sites #2 and #4 included the announcements in a clearly marked box that drew the attention of the visitor to the site, right on the home page so that students would be able to easily notice and read the newest announcements for the course and thus easily find important information. These were all aspects that I knew I wanted to use in the design of the websites I was working on.</p>

                            <br>

                            <h3>The Problem</h3>

                            <p>Keeping in mind the goal of modernizing the website, I also thought about how to best organize the information for the primary users of the website. Though I did not create formal personas for each of the users, I brainstormed and used each of the definite types of users of the site to help me figure out what kind of structure would be suitable and intuitive for the users. I wrote down their primary goals and motivations for going to the websites to refer to before coming up with a sketch:</p>

                            <br>

                            <img src="img/usergoals.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="User Type and Goals">

                            <br>

                            <h3>Initial Sketch</h3>

                            <p>After determining the most crucial parts of the websites through examining the different users and their primary goals when using the site, I took to paper to sketch out my ideas of how the new design would look. I also looked at the structure of the existing course websites in order to confirm what information I had available to be displayed on the site, as well as what the professor would like to carry over to the new site:</p>

                            <br>

                            <img src="img/sketchhome.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Initial Sketch of Home Page">

                            <br>

                            <h3>Proposed Changes</h3>

                            <p>For the navigation bar on the page, I changed the tabs available on the page by removing tabs that directly linked to PDF documents, such as the ISA (Integrity of Scholarship Agreement) tabs, since as a student (I took CSE 7 myself a year and a half prior to working on the sites), I did not need to regularly access that information; those documents were for occasional reference primarily at the beginning of the quarter, since we had to sign them and turn them in. Also, from all the websites I had used in the past, tabs typically represented separate pages of the site to navigate to; thus, I decided to move those PDF handouts and combine them with the home page for easy access.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>I moved the announcements to the home page because of their importance, since the professor would post new information and updates to communicate to the students in the course there. The remaining tabs I left alone, as they were all included in the primary goals of the users of the site. I did, however, change the name of the tab “Help” to “Tutor Hours” to make it more clear, as I felt that “Help” typically signified problems using the website, and the “Help” tab displayed the available tutors and their homework help hours.</p>

                            <br><br>

                            <h3>Building the Website</h3>

                            <p>Since the websites would be static, I coded them using HTML and CSS, and I utilized the Bootstrap framework for the built-in grid system and other features; I used the font-awesome library for icons. For the color scheme of the websites, I wanted to make the new sites appear professsional while still colorful, and thus I decided to use the official UCSD colors (found here: http://ucpa.ucsd.edu/brand/elements/color-palette/), specifically blue and gold. Sticking with the professional theme also meant using a professional looking font, and I thus chose to use Arial, particularly for accessibility and consistency across different devices.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>In order to ensure that I was accomplishing the goals for the new websites, I kept in mind the main keywords that reflected these goals when making design decisions and in the coding of the websites:</p>

                            <br>

                            <div class="list">

                                <p> •   professional/official: blue and gold color scheme, using the official UCSD communications colors, including the UC San Diego: Jacobs School of Engineering logo on the page (idea borrowed from the other UCSD Computer Science course website- Competitor #1 above), simple and professional font choice</p>
                                <p>•   school/class: use of tabs meant to look like manila folders/tabs on a page or in a binder</p>
                                <p>•   maintainable: use of comments throughout the code, for future webmasters of the site and the professor to reference (tutors for the class who volunteer to take over for managing the website), use of Bootstrap </p>
                                <p>•   responsive/modern: use of Bootstrap for built-in media queries/device sizes, hamburger menu for smaller device screens</p>

                            </div>

                            <br>

                            <h3>Final Product</h3>

                            <br>

                            <img src="img/CSE3Schedule.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="CSE 3 Schedule">
                            <img src="img/CSE3Syllabus.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="CSE 3 Syllabus">
                            <img src="img/CSE3LabsHmwk.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="CSE 3 Labs and Homework">

                            <br>

                            <p>The websites for both classes - CSE 3 and CSE 7 - are very similar, so only screens of the CSE 3 site are shown above. The professor was very happy with the sites. The one change that did occur was the usage of an iframe so that the professor could easily change the announcements without modifying the existing code; instead, she simply edited a separate HTML file for the announcements that she had to post, and replaced that file whenever she had any updates to add to the sites.</p>

                            <br>

                            <h3>The Takeaway</h3>

                            <p>Overall, I think that I accomplished my goals of maintainability and responsiveness, as well as embodying the themes of being an official UCSD course website and thus school-related and professional. The professor was also happy with how the websites turned out, which was important, since she had asked me to do the website redesigns and was the “client” for this redesign. The other tutors whom I spoke to in the fall quarter when the websites went live for the courses were able to quickly get comfortable with using the sites.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>Since I worked on the redesign of the sites over the summer, I was not in San Diego and thus was not able to conduct any tests of the sites with other tutors for the course and the professor. When I finished the websites and had a working version for each, I sent them over to the professor to get her to try it out on her own. I also performed some informal testing with some family members to observe how they navigated the sites and see if they had any issues using the sites. By following web conventions and commonly used features (such as the hamburger menu for smaller screens) as well as clear naming, I tried to keep the site relatively simple and intuitive to use. </p>

                            <br>

                            <p>What I would do differently had I had access to the primary users of the sites to test with in-person would be to get the professor and other tutors to use the sites while I took notes. This would have allowed me to identify any aspects of the sites that people had trouble with and could be improved upon as necessary. Due to time and resource constraints, as well as the nature of the project (the website was finished and made live once the fall quarter began, and it would be confusing for the professor, tutors, and students to update the site in the middle of the quarter), there was no formal testing that occurred during the quarter. With the given timeline (having been asked to redesign the websites right before I went home for summer break), I was also unable to conduct user interviews to identify other possible user needs I may have missed.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>Note: The website is only live during the quarter, and as such there is no working link at this time.</p>

                            <h3>Background</h3>
                            <p>This web app was created during January - March of 2014. For the Intro to Human Computer Interaction Design course at UCSD, we were given a 10 week timeline to complete a web app centered around the theme of mindfulness, bringing it from start to finish through the human-centered design process. My role involved doing initial research and ideation, prototyping, to working on the front-end design aspects of the application (colors, formatting), and conducting user tests.</p>

                            <h3>Ideation and Needfinding</h3>
                            <p>I started my observations around a place familiar to me: inside the weight room at the UCSD gym. Specifically, I observed individuals utilizing the squat racks and their smartphones for checking their workouts as well as entering the weights they used for each set. I noticed that the majority of people either shared a squat rack and rotated with each set, or they had to wait until a squat rack opened up whenever someone finished their sets.</p>

                            <img src="img/gym1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Needfinding in the gym 1">

                            <br>

                            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                            <p>Within the weight room, all of the more popular options (such as the squat rack) tend to be filled, and thus people are stuck waiting for uncertain amounts of time. In order to figure out when the squat rack would be open, people would either have to ask the person currently using the rack for the number of sets they have left, or they would simply stand nearby and keep an eye on the person to see when they finished. We all felt that there was a definite need for some system of scheduling squat racks, and thus… </p>

                            <br>

                            <img src="img/storyboard1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="storyboard part 1">
                            <img src="img/storyboard2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="storyboard part 2">

                            <p>One of the storyboards I made for our squat rack scheduler. We storyboarded and even paper prototyped before realizing our app didn’t directly address mindfulness.</p>

                            <br><br>


                            <h3>A Detour</h3>
                            <p>We were so focused on this particular problem (partly because all of us used the weight room and had faced this problem ourselves before) that we didn’t realize that our app idea, which involved reserving a time to use various pieces of exercise equipment and being able to view open time slots, had diverged from the original theme of mindfulness. How did our app help people to be more aware of their own cognitive and emotional states? </p>
                            <p>(Hint: It didn’t.)</p>

                            <br>

                            <h3>The (New) Problem</h3>
                            <p>And thus it was back to the drawing board, quite literally. After further pondering on the subject of mindfulness, we came up with the idea of an app for increasing mindfulness in the context of goal-setting and subsequently achieving those goals. The problem we identified was that people often don’t achieve the goals that they set for themselves because they lack awareness and mindfulness in terms of their progress towards their goals; without reminders and constant motivation, it becomes really easy for people to fall off track and abandon the goals they set. </p>

                            <br>

                            <p>Our proposed solution, in the form of the app Goal Patrol, is to facilitate the goal-setting process by turning it into a sort of mutual exchange. Instead of the existing apps that simply allow you to set and track your own goals, Goal Patrol lets you set a goal for a friend who, in turn, sets a goal for you. This is meant to foster closer relationships between the users, since the person setting you a goal needs to know you well enough in order to know what kinds of goals would be worth working towards for you, and also increase overall awareness of your own cognitive and emotional states when you track your progress and thoughts as you work towards the goal.</p>

                            <br>

                            <h3>Paper Prototyping</h3>

                            <br>

                            <img src="img/paperprot.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Goal Patrol Paper Prototype">

                            <br>

                            <p>The paper prototypes were made with mobile-first design in mind because we figured that this app should be used on the go, generally at any user’s convenience, since people will want to record their progress towards their goals whenever they remember to. </p>

                            <br>

                            <h3>Prototype Testing and Feedback</h3>

                            <p>We received feedback based on Nielsen’s ten heuristics after getting several people from other teams in the class to test our initial paper prototypes (the ones about the gym area scheduling app), but due to time constraints we were not able to do a separate test of our Goal Patrol prototype. However, we applied the comments to our new prototype as well; our previous prototypes did not have clear navigational controls, such as a menu button or back button, so our Goal Patrol paper prototype included back buttons on every screen as well as a menu button on the user’s home page. There were also issues with understanding what to do on each screen, so we accounted for that by adding the help icons on the goal-setting page to give tips on how to structure the goal. </p>

                            <br>

                            <h3>Making Goal Patrol</h3>
                            <p>For the coding of the application, we decided to make it a mobile web application due to the time constraints of the class (we had about three weeks for this portion). The application was implemented with Handlebars templates on the front end and Express, Node, and MongoDB on the backend; the application itself was deployed using Heroku. I worked primarily on the front end, which included picking out the color scheme and font for the application and other aspects of the styling, as well as tweaking the positioning and layout of the components on the pages.  </p>

                            <br>

                            <h3>Initial Usability Testing and Feedback</h3>

                            <p>User 2 did not understand the content of the home page and one of the button names.</p>

                            <br>

                            <p>Once we had a mostly functioning version of the Goal Patrol application, we conducted three user tests and collected feedback. I took notes and observed while the users interacted with the application on their smartphones. We recorded each session, allowing us to go back and review anything we may not have noticed during the actual tests. </p>

                            <br>

                            <p>During the tests, we noticed users’ pain points with the flow of the application, since there were some pages they could not figure out how to go back from, as well as other aspects of the page that were not easily understandable with the given information. We also took suggestions for features into account, such as the feature to send inspirational pieces such as quotes, personalized messages, and videos to friends using the app to keep them motivated while working towards their goals. The comments led to rearrangement of buttons on the pages as well as the addition of a “Help” page, shown below.</p>

                            <h3>Online Testing</h3>

                            <p>After the initial usability tests, we performed A/B testing using Google Analytics in order to see where users clicked to get to the home page; we wanted to see if having the “home” option in the dropdown menu was useful, or if having the clickable “Goal Patrol” logo in the upper left was enough. The testing was conducted over the span of three days, during which we had 36 unique visitors to the website. The results indicated that most users did not use the dropdown “home” option and went for the single click on the logo to return to the home page. Based on these results, we decided to make the clickability of the logo more obvious so that users can directly go back without having to make the extra click by opening the dropdown menu.</p>

                            <p>Based on the usability tests as well as the online testing results, we added a line underneath the Goal Patrol text in the upper left in order to indicate that it is clickable. We also enlarged some of the buttons to make it easier to click on a mobile device, and edited wording for clarification where necessary. The final color scheme that was picked was meant to mimic the gradient of the sunrise to give the users inspiration.</p>

                            <h3>The Takeaway and Future Improvements</h3>

                            <p>Given more time, it would have been a good idea to perform further rounds of usability tests with the application in order to determine whether or not the changes we made after the first usability tests solved the problems the users had with understanding our application. I learned that visual design sensibility takes time to develop, as I personally had a lot of trouble with finding a suitable color scheme as well as with the layout. For future improvements, I would want to revamp the color scheme and visual aspects of the application, perhaps based on color psychology so that the color can help with motivation. There were also a couple of features we did not manage to implement, such as uploading pictures and videos to send as “inspirational pieces” to friends using the app.</p>

                            <p>As historian of the team from 2014-2015, I worked with Kenny Li to implement the new UC San Diego Dragon Boat Team's website using HTML and CSS, as well as Bootstrap to add responsiveness, as the original website was made using weebly and was not maintained well. The new website was designed by Albert Liang (the current president of the team). The team website serves primarily to provide information to potential new recruits for the team each fall, and the site also allows team alumni to stay up to date on the race results of the team and to donate to the team. Sponsors and their logos are also displayed via the team website.</p>
                            
                            <p>The website has since been redesigned and redeveloped again, and as such, there is no live link at this time.</p>

                            <p>ItzLit was implemented with Express, NodeJs, MongoDB, the SpotCrime API, the Google Maps API, and OAuth to incorporate Facebook Login, using street light data available online from the county of San Diego. ItzLit is a web application created with the intent of allowing people to find the most well-lit route home (within San Diego County), thus encouraging a sense of safety in the users of the application. </p>
                            <p>The problem my team identified and wanted to address was that of students and staff who have to commute to and from campus, often times leaving campus late at night, and because people feel less safe traveling at night alone, the idea for ItzLit was born. ItzLit also helps people with poor night vision to find a more well-lit route to drive on, as there are options that the user can pick for mode of transportation when inputting their starting and ending locations. Data visualizations made using D3 were incorporated using crime data from the UCSD Delphi Database to provide users with visualizations for the types of crimes that have occurred in San Diego and thus to assess past crime history in the area. The SpotCrime API was used to get live crime data that is displayed on the map showing the different routes so that users can make their decision of what route to take based on how well-lit the route is as well as what types of crimes have recently occurred.</p>
